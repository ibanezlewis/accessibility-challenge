## Installation

To setup this repository, simply download the files top your local machine and use a code editor, like [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), to open and edit the files and see how the HTML is affected by the CSS.


## Usage 

The image below shows the intended layout of the mock landing page:

```md
![Intended landing page screenshot](assets/images/intended-landing-page-screenshot.png)
```
By tapping one of the links, you'll be directed to the appropriate section of the landing page.

The HTML shows what content the page is made up of, and the CSS is appropriately commented to show which area the CSS affects.
